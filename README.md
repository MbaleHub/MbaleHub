## Hi there 👋

I'm Eunice Mbale, a Technical Project Manager wrapping up my bootcamp with Tech4Dev (graduating December 5, 2025). I'm excited about bringing structure and clarity to technical projects while keeping teams aligned and stakeholders happy.

## A Bit About My Journey

Before diving into project management, I spent time in virtual assistance and customer support. That experience taught me how to communicate clearly, manage competing priorities, and keep workflows running smoothly—skills that translate directly into managing technical projects.

Now I'm taking those foundations and building on them with formal TPM training. I'm learning to speak the language of both technical teams and business stakeholders, which I think is where the real magic happens in project delivery.

## What I Bring to the Table

**Project Management Approach:**
- Agile and Scrum frameworks (I like the flexibility)
- Sprint planning that actually makes sense
- Stakeholder communication that keeps everyone in the loop
- Risk management (catching issues before they become fires)
- Documentation that people will actually read

**Tools I Work With:**
- Jira, ClickUp, Trello, and Notion for project tracking and task management
- Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace for collaboration and documentation
- HubSpot for CRM and customer relationship management
- Slack and Teams for keeping communication flowing
- GitHub (still learning, but getting there)

**What I'm Good At:**
- Getting different teams to work together smoothly
- Translating technical concepts for non-technical folks
- Spotting bottlenecks before they slow things down
- Writing clear documentation
- Adapting when plans change (because they always do)

## What's Next for Me

Right now I'm focused on:
- Building out this GitHub with real project examples
- Creating templates that other PMs might find useful
- Documenting what I learned during my bootcamp
- Deepening my technical knowledge so I can better support engineering teams

## Let's Connect

I'm actively looking for my first full-time Technical Project Manager role. If you're building something interesting and need someone who can keep projects moving forward, I'd love to chat.
